title: Bethany Oregon Government
---

The Bethany region of unincorporated Washington County is a rapidly growing community. It is situated near Beaverton and is north of Highway 26. Major employers in the region include Nike, Intel, Columbia Sportswear, and Tektronix.

Many people moving to the Bethany area are unsure of how their government and services work because the area has Portland addresses but they don't live in the City of Portland. So, I created this website to provide links to all of the disparate resources in the area.

## Protecting our Community

An unfortunate side effect of being in an unincorporated area is the community has fairly poorly designed land use laws. This has led to some very unfortunate community planning decisions that the community is trying to fix:

- An approved gas station which will [store 40,000 gallons of gasoline 80ft](https://nabgas.com) from the Rock Creek trail and wetland feeding Bethany Lake by developer [Bob Barman](https://bobbarman.com) - [Sign the petition](https://www.postpump.org/oregon/washington-county/land-use-letter)
- Unlike many cities in the area we have no tree protection code to encourage and protect space to keep large trees during a development. The [Treekeepers of Washington County](https://www.treekeeperswc.org) are working to fix that.
